#In order to test functionality locally (pertaining to GLO (AT&T Global Login)), you will need an AT&T cross
#domain cookie. Cadi "should" find your hostname for you. However, we have seen some situations where this fails. A Local testing
#modification can include modifying your hosts file so that you can use "mywebserver.att.com" for your localhost in order
#to test/verify GLO functionality locally. If you are on a Windows machine, you will already have a machine name associated with
#it that will utilize an AT&T domain such as "sbc.com". You may need to add your AT&T domain to this as a comma separated list depending
#upon your particular machine domain. This property is commented out as cadi SHOULD find your machine name. With version 1.2.1 of cadi,
#it appears to resolve Mac machine names as well, now. But, this can be somewhat inconsistent depending on your specific working envrironment.

#Setting csp_domain to PROD will allow for testing using your attuid and password through GLO.
